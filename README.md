What does this code do?
1. Parses an STL file and stores the data in a Vertex-Edge-Face data structure
2. Applies the force specified (in code) to the imported object at the specified points (in code)
3. The deflections on the object (which is assumed to be comprised of masses and springs) are computed and the object geometry is updated on the screen
